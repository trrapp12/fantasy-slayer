### PERFORMANCE

**Original score:** 56%
**Improved score:**

*these are things I've done, just trying to figure out what category to put them in*

moved the js files so that they were in their proper of rendering
separated CSS style sheets into the most basic from what could be rendered later and made what could be rendered later load asynchronously
split out 800 lines of html from footer into it's own file that will only load when a user interacts with the link, thereby cleaning up the code and code splitting
added async to the html tags for the last three script tags so they wouldn't have to load synchronously
used a bundler to minify the code
To prevent FOIT: 

added following to preload:

  <link rel="preload" href="css/critical.css" as="style">
  <link rel="preload" as="style" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Aboreto&display=swap">

added font-display: optional;

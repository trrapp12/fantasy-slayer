To add to his shame they refused to take him prisoner, but sent him home to bear his shame in front of his land and people.  He vowed he would not return until his honor was restored.  So for ten years he lay in the wilderness, learning every type of war nature wages, from the persistence of the sun to the brutality of a hungry mother bear, to the coordination of an invading ant colony, to the stealth of moon-silk spider. Now he stands ready to complete his vow.',
